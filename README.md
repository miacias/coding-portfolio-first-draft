# Mia Ciasullo's Coding Portfolio

## Description
This built-from-scratch project is all about getting myself out there as a developer, showing my recent works, and connecting with other professionals in the field. In this page is an About Me, Portfolio, and Contact section as well as some extra information about the formative education that has led me here. The primary goal is to use this site as a tool to engage in conversations with peers and to seek employment based.

I learned the value of styling via CSS and the wonders that accompany its more advanced features such as:
* flexbox - allows for responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes
* key frames - enables animation!
* pseudo-classes - activates basic interactivity with the site's elements
* media queries - dictates the design element changes for specific screens

## Assets
